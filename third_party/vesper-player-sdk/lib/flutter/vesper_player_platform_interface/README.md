# vesper_player_platform_interface

The shared platform interface for `vesper_player`.

This package defines the cross-platform abstractions, DTOs, and event contracts
used by the federated Flutter plugin. It is intended for platform plugin
authors. Application code should usually depend on `vesper_player` directly.

## What This Package Contains

### Platform abstraction

- `VesperPlayerPlatform`: the abstract base class every platform package must extend
- `VesperPlatformCreateResult`: the result type returned by `createPlayer`
- `VesperBenchmarkConfiguration`: opt-in benchmark capture and console logging settings forwarded by `createPlayer`
- `VesperPlayerRenderSurfaceKind`: Flutter-facing Android render surface preference forwarded by `createPlayer`
- `VesperSourceNormalizerConfiguration`: optional mobile plugin diagnostics / source preflight configuration, disabled by default
- `VesperFrameProcessorConfiguration`: optional mobile FrameProcessor capability diagnostics configuration, disabled by default
- `VesperSystemPlaybackConfiguration`: optional system media session and background audio integration
- `VesperExternalPlaybackAvailability`: AirPlay / Cast route availability DTOs for optional UI and platform packages
- External playback DTOs used by optional Cast / DLNA packages, including route,
  media item, result, and session event models

## Implementing A New Platform Package

Extend `VesperPlayerPlatform` and register your implementation in
`registerWith()`:

```dart
class VesperPlayerMyPlatform extends VesperPlayerPlatform {
  static void registerWith() {
    VesperPlayerPlatform.instance = VesperPlayerMyPlatform();
  }

  @override
  Future<VesperPlatformCreateResult> createPlayer({...}) async {
    // Platform implementation.
  }

  // Implement the remaining abstract members here.
}
```

Methods that remain unimplemented should report `VesperPlayerError` with
`code: VesperPlayerErrorCode.unsupported` and
`category: VesperPlayerErrorCategory.capability`. That keeps capability checks
explicit and lets apps branch on `VesperPlayerCapabilities` instead of
depending on exceptions.

Snapshot payloads should also round-trip the backend's current
`VesperPlaybackResiliencePolicy`, `VesperTrackSelectionSnapshot`, and
best-effort `effectiveVideoTrackId`, plus raw `videoVariantObservation`
evidence when the backend can expose bitrate and rendered size directly.
Backends should also provide `fixedTrackStatus` when they can observe
fixed-track convergence directly, so Flutter UI can render the effective
runtime state instead of only optimistic local intent.

`createPlayer` also accepts `renderSurfaceKind` and `benchmarkConfiguration`.
Android platform packages should map `auto` to `SurfaceView` for Flutter 3.44+
native video playback and keep explicit `textureView` as the compatibility path
for overlay-heavy or animation-heavy host screens. Native implementations
should forward benchmark settings to the host kit and keep `consoleLogging`
disabled by default.

Mobile plugin configurations are intentionally conservative. SourceNormalizer
`diagnosticsOnly` and `preflightOnly` report plugin diagnostics without changing
the platform source. `preferNormalized` and `requireNormalized` are explicit
normalized-resource modes owned by the Android and iOS host kits; Flutter only
passes configuration and decodes diagnostics. FrameProcessor `diagnosticsOnly`
must report availability without opening frame sessions or marking the plugin
as participated.

Coarse capability fields such as `supportsTrackSelection` or
`supportsAbrPolicy` should not be treated as implicit support for every
fine-grained mode. Platform plugins should populate fields like
`supportsVideoTrackSelection`, `supportsAbrFixedTrack`, and
`supportsAbrMaxResolution` explicitly.
