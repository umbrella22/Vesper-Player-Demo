# vesper_player_ui

Optional Flutter UI controls and player stage built on top of `vesper_player`.

This package provides ready-made widgets that consume a `VesperPlayerController`
so apps can adopt a polished player surface without re-implementing controls,
gestures, fullscreen, or bottom sheets.

## Status

Experimental. The widgets and APIs are not yet frozen and may change between
minor releases. Pin the version explicitly when consuming.

## What's Included

Exported from `package:vesper_player_ui/vesper_player_ui.dart`:

- `VesperPlayerStage` — opinionated player stage with controls overlay,
  gestures (double-tap seek, drag scrub), fullscreen toggle, and sheet entry
  points. Hosts can pass `topBarPrimaryAction` and `topBarSecondaryAction` for
  Cast, AirPlay, DLNA, or custom menu buttons that should follow the stage
  overlay
- Stage helpers: bottom-sheet entry types, formatting helpers
- Stage models: presentation-layer DTOs consumed by `VesperPlayerStage`
- Stage device controls: brightness / volume gesture wiring helpers
- `VesperAirPlayRouteButton` — iOS `AVRoutePickerView` wrapper bound to the
  active `VesperPlayerController`
- `VesperAirPlayRouteIconButton` — stage-sized AirPlay route picker wrapper for
  `VesperPlayerStage.topBarPrimaryAction`

## Installation

The Flutter packages are source-distributed from this repository and currently
set `publish_to: none`. In a host app, use path or git dependencies until the
package family is published:

```yaml
dependencies:
  vesper_player:
    path: path/to/rust-player-sdk/lib/flutter/vesper_player
  vesper_player_ui:
    path: path/to/rust-player-sdk/lib/flutter/vesper_player_ui
```

`vesper_player_ui` depends on `vesper_player`. Apps that build their own UI
can depend on `vesper_player` directly and skip this package.

`VesperPlayerStage` keeps decorative full-stage overlays non-interactive, so
empty video-space gestures continue to work while controls are visible. Only
the actual buttons, sheet entries, and timeline receive pointer events.

`VesperAirPlayRouteButton` is an iOS-only route picker. It renders an empty box
on non-iOS platforms so shared control rows can keep a stable layout.

Use `VesperAirPlayRouteIconButton` inside a stage top-bar action slot when the
AirPlay picker should hide and show with the player controls.

`VesperPlayerStage` uses English labels by default. Apps can replace only the
stage copy without rebuilding the stage controls:

```dart
VesperPlayerStage(
  controller: controller,
  snapshot: snapshot,
  isPortrait: isPortrait,
  strings: const VesperPlayerStageStrings.zhHans(),
  onOpenSheet: onOpenSheet,
  onToggleFullscreen: onToggleFullscreen,
)
```

## Minimum Requirements

- Dart SDK 3.6.0+
- Flutter 3.44.0+
