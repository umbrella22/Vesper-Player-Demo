# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-18

### Breaking Changes

- FFmpeg mobile builds now use `./scripts/vesper ffmpeg --platform android|ios|all --profile <name>` as the public CLI. The old public `android ffmpeg`, `android ffmpeg-runtime`, and `apple ffmpeg` commands were removed from `scripts/vesper`.
- Android Cast, DLNA, relay, and relay FFmpeg split modules were consolidated into `vesper-player-kit-external-playback` with public APIs under `io.github.ikaros.vesper.player.android.external`.

### Added

- Added `scripts/ffmpeg-profiles.toml` with `base`, `download-remux`, `relay-remux`, and `default` FFmpeg profiles, including inheritance, platform overrides, overlays, validation, and stable profile hashes.
- Added Android release staging for `VesperPlayerKitComposeUi`, `VesperPlayerKitExternalPlayback`, and `VesperPlayerKitFfmpegRuntime` AARs.
- Added optional iOS `VesperPlayerFfmpegRuntime.xcframework.zip` and `VesperPlayerRemuxFfmpegPlugin.xcframework.zip` staging so FFmpeg-backed remux support stays out of the core `VesperPlayerKit.xcframework`.

### Changed

- `download-remux`, `relay-remux`, and `default` profiles validate local-only remux builds with network and OpenSSL disabled by default.
- Flutter external playback on Android now calls the consolidated Kotlin external playback facade while preserving the Dart API.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-05-13

### Breaking Changes

- Android: JNI, bridge, and `Native*` payload types are no longer public API. Use `VesperPlayerController`, `VesperPlayerSource`, `VesperTrackSelection`, `VesperVideoSurfaceKind`, and the download/preload facades instead.
- Android: DLNA and relay artifacts no longer set global `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"`. Host apps that use local-network HTTP playback must opt in explicitly in their own manifest or network security configuration.
- Android: `vesper-player-kit-compose` now provides only controller binding and surface attachment. Visual styling such as rounded corners, background, and outline belongs in `vesper-player-kit-compose-ui` or host UI.
- Flutter: external playback DTOs moved to `vesper_player_platform_interface`; `vesper_player_external_playback` no longer owns parallel public DTO definitions.
- Rust: `player-model` is now a DTO-only crate. The Tokio actor/controller types moved to `player-runtime`.
- Rust: `DownloadTaskSnapshot.asset_index` is now shared as `Arc<DownloadAssetIndex>` so polling manager snapshots no longer deep-clones resource and segment lists.
- Rust/plugin ABI: decoder plugins now use ABI v3 and typed native device context payloads such as `DecoderNativeDeviceContext::D3D11Device { device_ptr }`. The old generic `{ kind, handle }` native context payload is not accepted.
- iOS FFI: `player-ffi-ios` error codes and categories now align with the desktop FFI error taxonomy.

### Fixed

- Added panic containment to iOS FFI entry points, macOS AVFoundation callbacks, and plugin-loader progress callbacks.
- Added panic containment to decoder and remux plugin entry points and ABI callbacks so plugin panics are mapped to ABI error payloads.
- Replaced production panic paths in Windows probing, timeline ratio seeking, FFmpeg timestamp/audio conversion, and JNI signature helpers.
- Reworked `player-audio-cpal` around an `rtrb` SPSC audio ring so the CPAL callback no longer locks the shared timeline or allocates output chunks.
- Added shared iOS `AVAudioSession` ownership, interruption handling, route-change pause behavior, and `isInterrupted` state propagation.
- Restricted Android relay default binding to a Wi-Fi LAN address and fail fast when no LAN address is available.
- Hardened Android DLNA discovery so stale description fetches cannot publish routes after discovery stops, and SSDP NOTIFY falls back when port 1900 is already bound.
- Clamped download progress updates to known byte and segment totals, and forced paused in-flight preparation tasks to re-run preparation before resuming.
- Added a backend-level FFmpeg `MasterClock` abstraction with audio-as-master selection for desktop A/V synchronization.
- Added Android host-kit API surface verification to block bridge, JNI, and `Native*` implementation types from re-entering the public API.
- Preserved Flutter viewport state across app lifecycle transitions.
